# Quick Start

Our API is RESTful, so any programming language will support interaction, but the document will provide examples for curl, Python and C# (coming soon).
Before calling private APIs, you should create an authenticated session. Itâ€™s cookie-based, so library needs to save cookies and pass them back with continuous calls, in most programming languages it will be done automatically, so nothing complicated.

{% method %}

{% sample lang="postman" %}
![](/assets/login.png)

{% sample lang="python" %}
```python
import requests

login_url = 'htts://integration-test.gettipsi.com/api/rest/v001/login'
response = requests.post(login_url, {'username': 'USERNAME', 'password': 'PASSWORD'})

if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Logged in successfully')
else:
    print('Login failed')        
```
{% endmethod %}

If response status code is 200, you logged in successfully. Once it happened, any further call will contain session ID in cookies header.
{% method %}
{% sample lang="postman" %}
![](/assets/list-wine-inventory.png)

{% sample lang="python" %}
```python
def fetch_wines():
    url = 'https://integration-test.gettipsi.com/api/rest/v001/store/STORE_ID/wine'
    response = requests.get(url,
        {'inventory_fields': 'id,barcodes,wine',
        'wine_fields': 'id,name,vintage'})
    return response.json()

login()
fetch_wines()
```
{% endmethod %}

Once you get your code working on test server, change it to production and go live!
