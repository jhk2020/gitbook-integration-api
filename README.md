# Introduction

Tipsi integration API implemented as REST and provides ability to interact with your retail data programmatically.
Supported operations described below:

* [List or create operations](/crud-operations.md):
* [Read, update, delete operations using external ids](/access-using-external-id.md)
* [Full text search across Tipsi database](/full-text-search.md)
* [POS synchronization](/pos-sync.md)
* [Label Processing Tasks Guide](/create-tasks.md)

Our production integration server domain is **integration.gettipsi.com**, we also provide a separate sandbox for experiments - **integration-test.gettipsi.com**, on that domain you can play with API without worries to accidentally break anything.

Now it's time to check [quick start](/quick-start.md).
